I've learned a lot about the programming sense and a lot to learn above, I give a lot of time for the programming logic because figuring out logic is the mindset of a programmer. This internship is relevant to what I have been studying and learning since I joined college, so if you consider me for this internship I will try my best to be the best recruiter you could have.











I am available for the entire January, February, and March and after that, I may not be available afterward for quite some time because I will be having the semester exams that I have to prepare for. So, I'll have ups and downs in the month of April and May with the timing but given time I will do as I am instructed and get your work done.







I can start the internship immediately.
